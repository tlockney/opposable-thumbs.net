Well, seeing as how this blog is called [Opposable Thumbs](http://opposable-thumbs.net/ "Opposable Thumbs"), I finally decided that I should have a matching domain name. Unfortunately, opposablethumbs.com, opposablethumbs.net, etc. were all taken, but I was able to get the hyphenated [opposable-thumbs.net](http://opposable-thumbs.net/). **Let the thumb fights begin!**
