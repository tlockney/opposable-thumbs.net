Well, as you may or may not notice, this site is going under the knife. I've been pretty tired of the old look (it was one of the template styles available with MoveableType) for a long time, but just finally decided to dig in and make it work. I'm using CSS pretty heavily, so it may or may not look quite right in various browsers. I'm going to continue tweaking it a lot, so expect to see changes.
