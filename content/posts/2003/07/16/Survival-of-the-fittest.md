Read [Creation Science Fair 2001](https://web.archive.org/web/20030805211132/http://objective.jesussave.us/creationsciencefair.html "OBJECTIVE: Creation Education: Creation Science Fair 2001") for an example of some good, old fashioned non-science and an example of why our future is pretty bleak if this kind of garbage continues to be taught.
