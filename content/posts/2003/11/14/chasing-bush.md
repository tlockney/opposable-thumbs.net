[This](https://web.archive.org/web/20031205014259/http://www.interwebnet.org/) is truely inspired. For those of you who don't know already, the current administration has asked the UK to basically shutdown large portions of it's normally publicly accessible streets (including whole businesses, I believe) in order to avoid protestors. It seems the some are going to try and make this rather hard to manage. Wish I was there to join in the fun.
