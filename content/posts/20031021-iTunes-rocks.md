After hearing from all my Mac using friends how much iTunes rocks, I was pleasantly surprised to see that Apple recently released a version for Windows (which is unfortunately still my main work platform). There's not a whole lot to it, but I have to say, it's quickly become my favorite interface for listening to mp3s. 

Among it's wonderful features that I love is the ability to mass edit the file info -- for example, I can quickly update all the mp3 files for a single album if, for instance, some of the information was missing when it was originally ripped. Also, the ability to step through the listings while editing file info is truely empowering -- this, in addition to the previous item, makes it especially easy to fix poor file meta data.

There's a number of other features (sharing, streaming, smart playlists, etc.) that I haven't even begun to dig into, but what I love best about this thing is just how simple it is. There's not a lot of clutter on the interface. Contrast this with the often hard to find buttons on WinAmps interface and you'll understand what I'm talking about.
