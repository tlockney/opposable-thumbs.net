The [Daily Mis-Lead](https://web.archive.org/web/20031024225714/http://www.misleader.org/daily_mislead/ "Misleader.org: Daily Mislead") is my new favorite inbox item. It's a daily email that provides continual updates on how Shrub is leading us furthur and furthur down the path to hell. Brilliant. Truely brilliant. Read [today's](https://web.archive.org/web/20031024225714/http://www.misleader.org/daily_mislead/Read.asp?fn=df09252003.html) item, describing how Bush's self-appointed inspectors are failing to find the so-called weapons of mass destruction. What's amazing is that he hasn't even bothered to have some planted at this point.
