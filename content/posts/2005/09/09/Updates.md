Well, lots has been going on lately. Too much, in fact, to bother keeping up with this blog. And, of course, there’s that whole things where each time something else goes on I find myself thinking, “well, there’s another thing I haven’t gotten around to blogging about.” And after a while the load just piles up so high…

So, we’re in Portland now. Oregon, not Maine. It’s beautiful here. Nicole started [law school](https://web.archive.org/web/20060614141004/http://www.lclark.edu/). We’ve got a lovely apartment. The dogs are happy. And I’ve switched from [Wordpress](https://web.archive.org/web/20060614141004/http://wordpress.org/) to [http://typo.leetsoft.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20060614141004/http://typo.leetsoft.com/). 

Hope all is well with everyone else out there.
