So, I've recently been taking a few trips down memory lane. Maybe it's just the normal thing in times of change. But one thing I've been thinking a lot about is legacy and what we leave behind. Not that I'm trying to be maudlin, but whatever. 

I recently went through this in the form of [revisiting my time at Nike](posts/2021/06/looking-back/), but I've also been thinking a lot about the endurance of one of the things I'm most proud of: the start of what became [DorkbotPDX](http://dorkbotpdx.org/). I'm not sure I'll get the full story right, but let's see what I can pull out of the ether.
