So, just a quick update to let anyone who cares know I finally dumped [Typo](https://web.archive.org/web/20071226040630/http://typosphere.org/) and moved over to [Mephisto](https://web.archive.org/web/20071226040630/http://mephistoblog.com/). I'm using Mephisto to manage some other sites, so it just seemed to make sense to stick to one system. Nothing much else to say except that I'm sure most any links pointing here are probably now broken. Oh well, such is life. Get on with it...
