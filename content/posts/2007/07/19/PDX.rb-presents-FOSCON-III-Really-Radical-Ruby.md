Once again the Portland Ruby Brigade will be hosting an evening of wide ranging talks about Ruby. This year the focus is on people doing strange things with Ruby. Strange, of course, is anything just a bit outside the usual. If you've created a new Ruby-based interface for hacking your brand new internet-enabled phone (rPhone anyone?) or composed your latest bit of metaprogramming magic, we'd love to hear about it.

Rather than having a fixed list of presenters, we're keeping it open-ended and free form. We'll use the lightning talk inspired approach and give you each a 10 minute slot to tell us what you can cram in. Make it especially interesting and we might even give you an extra minute or two. Let us know (send email to tlockney+foscon@gmail.com) in advance if you are interested in presenting or show up early on the 24th to sign up for any remaining slots (we'll hold a few open until the event itself).

This will all be taking place on Tuesday, July 24th, 7:30PM at Holocene (http://www.holocene.org/) here in Portland, Oregon. This just happens to be the same week as O'Reilly's Open Source Convention and the final day of Ubuntu Live. So if you're in town for either of those or close enough to come join us anyway, you're more then welcome.

There will be plenty of Ruby fun going on and lots of socializing with other people interested in Ruby. Last year, FOSCON II was overflowing. We've found a new venue to fit you all in, so why would you miss it?
