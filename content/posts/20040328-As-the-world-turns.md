There's an interesting story over at [In Case You Didn't Feel Like Showing Up](https://web.archive.org/web/20040530171637/http://jroller.com/page/mschinc/20040326#the_eclipse_web_tools_soap "In Case You Didn't Feel Like Showing Up") describing the convoluted progress of the Eclipse Web Tools project. It certainly dims my outlook quite a bit. So much for the excitement.
