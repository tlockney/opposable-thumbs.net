[Here](https://web.archive.org/web/20040530171637/http://java.sun.com/docs/hotspot/threads/threads.html)'s an interesting article on how java threads map onto the OS level threads under Solaris. Currently trying to diagnose and improve some performance problems on a production application server. This is some very cool stuff. I love getting this low level. Someday soon I've got to learn more about the VM.
