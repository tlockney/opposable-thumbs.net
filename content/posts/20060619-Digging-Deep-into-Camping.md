For a while now I’ve been watching the development of [Camping](https://web.archive.org/web/20060718205610/http://camping.rubyforge.org/files/README.html). I’m not sure anyone can really trace [where or how Camping came about ](https://web.archive.org/web/20060718205610/http://redhanded.hobix.com/bits/campingAMicroframework.html)– I’m sure [why](https://web.archive.org/web/20060718205610/http://whytheluckystiff.net/) won’t reveal the true history. It has to be an interesting story. 

I’ve only played around with creating Camping applications a little bit, but I’ve found it’s quite intuitive and easy. The funny thing about this is that the source of Camping itself is quite the opposite in many ways. Of course, it doesn’t help if you try to read the [compressed version](https://web.archive.org/web/20060718205610/http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/camping/browser/trunk/lib/camping.rb), but the [unabridged version](https://web.archive.org/web/20060718205610/http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/camping/browser/trunk/lib/camping-unabridged.rb) is not too hard to read. Understanding what’s going on, on the other hand, isn’t quite so straightforward.

I’ve been spending a few minutes here and there over the last week or so trying to comprehend all the little why-isms in there. It’s quite a learning experience. I plan to start writing up some of my notes and thoughts on how Camping works over the coming days and weeks. I hope everyone enjoys it. If you’re not deeply into [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), you might just go away and check back in a few weeks. `;~)`
