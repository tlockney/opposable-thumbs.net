Well, I suspected it might happen eventually, but I've finally been cutoff. That is, the powers that be at work have decided that the company is in great danger because of the rampant internet usage that it's employees were guilty of. So, rather than going on about this, I'll just point out the obvious, which is that my posting here will likely be even less frequent unless I develop a serious internet habit away from work; which is doubtful since I already spend 8 to 10 hours a day in front of my computer just for the daily drone.
