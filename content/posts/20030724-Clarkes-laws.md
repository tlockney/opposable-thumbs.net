1. First Law: When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.
2. Second Law: The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.
3. Third Law: Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
