Now, there's an interesting way to look at things:

> On which point, incidentally, I'm vaguely (ie not really) hoping for a Bush victory: not for political reasons [as much as I'm allowed to given my British citizenship and living in Italy and all, I find the guy deeply objectionable on every count] but because a Bush victory will hopefully cause the US Liberals to either rent some cojones from someone or move en masse over here. The prospects for good conversation are thereby doubled either way. The greatest thing the European Union could do on the day after a Bush election win would be to declare free work visas for anyone who pledged to come over and stay for the course of the term. Someone should suggest it to Chirac.
