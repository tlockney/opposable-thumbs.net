So, the whole many-shades-of-gray thing was getting to be just a bit much. I also wanted a little bit more of a refined feel here, so I've done a bit of tweaking to the stylesheet. Also, I've added/modified a few things over in the sidebar. First, the archives are now all rolled up into a selectbox. You can select a month/year combination to view that particular archive. Also, I've added a feature that pulls in a list of recent links I've added to my [link blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20040403125935/http://opposable-thumbs.net/linkblog/). I haven't really spent much time figuring out the best way to maintain this or a good design for it or anything, but it'll give you a reasonable view into the things I've been checking out lately.
