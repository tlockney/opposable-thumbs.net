[Jeffrey Veen](https://web.archive.org/web/20040722054847/http://www.veen.com/jeff/archives/000573.html "Jeffrey Veen: MP3 Blogs and wget") describes a dead simple way to grab mp3s automagically using wget. This is fun! I've already got lots of new stuff to listen to.

Next step is to write a script to grab these files when I jack into the home network with my laptop (I download them onto my home linux server) and import them directly into iTunes. Which shouldn't be too hard since I just discovered the iTunes COM interface last week.
