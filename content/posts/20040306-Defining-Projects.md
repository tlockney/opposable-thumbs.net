Ever since I met Nicole one of the many, many things I've admired about her is the clear sense of the projects, goals and to-do list type items she has to take care of. Of course, she's a keep of lists, something I've never been very good at. Recently, I've decided to try and start making this an element of my organizational strategy (if you can call it that). I asked Nicole for advice and she suggested that I start with a list of my projects. Unfortunately, I don't know what to classify as a project. Is it too big? Is it too small? How do I put the things many little things that are floating around in my head into concrete form. 

Well, today I stumbled on [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20040403125935/http://www.davidco.com/tips_tools/tip46.html) little write up, part of organizational guru [David Allen's](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) website. Looks like some good info. Going to have to read more of this stuff.
