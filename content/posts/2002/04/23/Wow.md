It's been a while since I updated this. I just finished setting up (well, finished is a loaded word, I guess) [blosxom](https://web.archive.org/web/20030803121737/http://www.oreillynet.com/~rael/lang/perl/blosxom) to be the default homepage for my site. Clearly (as the previous post indicates) I started down this path a while back, but other things....


 The tough part was not, of course, setting up blosxom (although I do find that I'm _constantly_ misspelling the name - it caused me quite a bit of confusion trying to synchronize my desktop system with my server). The difficult part was figuring out how to structure my site and the dynamically rendered components (which use HTML::Template) in conjunction with the blosxom generate piece. In the end I decided just not to worry about it - they each stand alone. I'll figure the rest out later.
