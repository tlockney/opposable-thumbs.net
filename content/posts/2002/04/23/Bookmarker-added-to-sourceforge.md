I've recently set up one of my projects that I've been working on in my spare time on [Sourceforge](https://web.archive.org/web/20030803121737/http://sourceforge.net/). It's in the nav bar at the right (under the projects link) if you want to check it out. It's just a simple tool for keeping a set of bookmarks in a centralized repository, but I have big plans for it.... Big plans indeed. More to come.
