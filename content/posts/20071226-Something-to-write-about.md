[Greg Borenstein](https://web.archive.org/web/20090205154227/http://www.urbanhonking.com/ideasfordozens) has put together a list of [50 blog posts he'd like to see in 2008](https://web.archive.org/web/20090205154227/http://www.urbanhonking.com/ideasfordozens/archives/2007/12/50_blog_posts_i.html). His theme that drives the list is "I know Ruby. Now what?" I see at least a couple in there that I could probably write a few useful sentences about, so maybe I'll have to give it a shot. What I really like about this list is that there are a number of ideas in there that could be written up in fairly short posts while still saying something worthwhile. Also, it covers a good deal of ground. There's more than a handful that I'd love to see written up, too. So get to it!
