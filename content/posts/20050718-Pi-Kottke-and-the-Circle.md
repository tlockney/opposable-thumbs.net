Kottke acutely [points out the “meaning” of Pi](https://kottke.org/05/07/pi-god-supercomputers):

> Oh, and as for patterns hidden in pi, we’ve already found one. It’s called the circle. Just because humans discovered circles first and pi later shouldn’t mean that the latter is derived from the former.
