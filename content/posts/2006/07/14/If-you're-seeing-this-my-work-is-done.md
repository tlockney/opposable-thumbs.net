So, I finally gave up on trying to host my site using a friends generously donated space on his reseller hosting account. While the company claimed to support Ruby and Rails, I had a hell of a time getting it working and when I finally did, I could only ever get things to run as CGI. Which, as anyone who has used Rails under CGI, simply blows. I'm now on [Site5](https://web.archive.org/web/20070613015007/http://www.site5.com/). I've heard both good and bad things about them, but the price was right and so far things seem to be working pretty well. 

The only real hickup seemed to be that the host I was set up on didn't have the mysql gem installed. Weird, I know, but I guess they must not have any other Rails sites hosted on that box. I'm not going to complain about that. Besides, they fixed it within minutes of my sending the support ticket.

I also upgrade to the latest SVN trunk version of [Typo](https://web.archive.org/web/20070613015007/http://typosphere.org/). Of course, none of the themes I installed seemed to work, so I'm using one of the built in, barebones themes. Maybe I'll create my own... with all that infinite free time I have.

Ok, time for bed. Tomorrow I'll try to write a bit about all the crazy things I've brought on to keep me from ever having a lack of things to do. ;~)
