A few days ago, [Chad Fowler
‘s](https://web.archive.org/web/20060614141004/http://www.chadfowler.com/) new book [Rails Recipes](https://web.archive.org/web/20060614141004/http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_rr/) was released in beta by the [Pragmatic Programmers](https://web.archive.org/web/20060614141004/http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/). As soon as I saw this, I printed out and read the excerpts they were making available. As I had hoped, they were great. Aside from a few typos (to be expected for a beta), the quality was excellent and I’ve already learned a few tricks. It was fun setting up mini-rails projects and quickly running through each recipe. I find examples are often the best way to learn things and this book is exactly the ticket.

Last night I went ahead and bought the beta PDF. I’m looking forward to reading the rest of it and watching it evolve through the beta process.
