I can’t believe I just used [that](https://web.archive.org/web/20060614141004/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogosphere) word… well, I’m back. Some shifting of hosts and wrestling with ruby, rails, typo and some missing ruby gems on the new host, and here I am again. 

I’ve also now got [Drivel](https://web.archive.org/web/20060614141004/http://www.dropline.net/drivel/) running, so adding posts should be a little smoother. And smoother means more frequent, right? Well, we’ll see about that.
