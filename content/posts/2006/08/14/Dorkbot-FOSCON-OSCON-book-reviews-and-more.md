So, just a quick update to let everyone know why I've disappeared and have been unable to find even a few spare seconds to update the blog. I've been just a wee bit busy.

Last month I attended [OSCON](https://web.archive.org/web/20071012184444/http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2006/) and helped put on [FOSCON II](https://web.archive.org/web/20071012184444/http://oscamp.org/FOSCON). Both of which were awesome and exhausting. I met a lot of great people and learned about some interesting things. Hopefully I'll find time to dig in a bit deeper on some of it.

Since then I've been working on two new projects. The first has been tech reviewing a new book for O'Reilly that's coming out later this year. More on that later.

But the most important activity in my mind has been putting together [dorkbotpdx](https://web.archive.org/web/20071012184444/http://dorkbot.org/dorkbotpdx/), the Portland chapter of the truely amazing [dorkbot](https://web.archive.org/web/20071012184444/http://dorkbot.org/) group. This one is certainly going to lead to more blog fodder, but that, too, will have to wait.
