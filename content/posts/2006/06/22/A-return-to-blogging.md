I've decided to give a new browser a spin and see how it handles things. As my last post may have indicated to you already, the browser in question is called F[lock](https://web.archive.org/web/20070613015007/http://www.flock.com/). It makes a claim towards being the browser for the web 2.0 world. Well, maybe not so specifically, but it integrates various web-services in an attempt to make the browsing experience a little more... well, just more. It's hard to explain exactly what it brings to the table without simply listing it's features and that's just boring, so I'll leave it to [this fine review](https://web.archive.org/web/20070613015007/http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,1978838,00.asp) on ExtremeTech to do that for me.  

Anyway, among the features that are important to me, I will mention one: it has an integrate blog posting tool. I know I've made the claim in the past that various tools might finally lead me to keeping up with this blogging thing a little better, but putting the tool right in the browsers seems to me the right way to get it done.
