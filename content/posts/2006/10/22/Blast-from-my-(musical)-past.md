My good friend Justin just sent me [this nice little bit of memorabilia](https://web.archive.org/web/20071026073901/http://opposable-thumbs.net/files/masterbuilt1.jpg). This was a brief lived band called Masterbuilt. Fun band but we just couldn't keep it happening for some reason. That's Kirk on the left, me in the middle, Justin on the right and Zack hidden back behind those drums.
