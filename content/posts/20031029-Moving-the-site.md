I've been doing some thinking lately about the work that I've been doing and plan to do outside of my [primary job](https://web.archive.org/web/20031203004239/http://www.esoterix.com/). I was recently talking to a friend about doing some work for his company as an independent consultant. It occured to me that I don't have much in the way of a professional face to present to him or his employers even though I have a background in this sort of work.

As fate would have it, a number of months back I registered an additional domain for this site: [opposable-thumbs.net](https://web.archive.org/web/20031203004239/http://opposable-thumbs.net/). The original plan was that it would simply be an alias for [lockney.net](https://web.archive.org/web/20031203004239/http://lockney.net/), but it occured to me that I could use this distinction to seperate out my blog site from my professional site quite easily. 

So today I made a few subtle changes. It won't be obvious to most of you, but when you link to [lockney.net](https://web.archive.org/web/20031203004239/http://lockney.net/) you will be redirected to [opposable-thumbs.net](https://web.archive.org/web/20031203004239/http://opposable-thumbs.net/). The intention is to create a new site that will live at [lockney.net](https://web.archive.org/web/20031203004239/http://lockney.net/) which will include work related information, while [opposable-thumbs.net](https://web.archive.org/web/20031203004239/http://opposable-thumbs.net/) will be dedicated to content of a personal nature.

Stay tuned for more info.
