A while back I agreed to do tech reviews for two Ruby books from O’Reilly. The first of these, [Ajax on Rails](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596527440.do) by Scott Raymond, was just published a few weeks ago. It looks to be quite an excellent piece of work (of course, I know the tech reviewing was top notch ;~). I just [received word](https://web.archive.org/web/20071226040630/http://blog.tupleshop.com/2007/1/19/announcing-the-rails-cookbook) that the second, [Rails Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596527310.do) by Rob Orsini, has been published, too.

Both look to be worth picking up. I’ll be posting more about both soon, I hope.
