I've just added a few new things to the sidebar at the right. These won't appear on the other pages of the site (not that there are exactly a lot of them), they're just sort of complement to the weblog section (front page, you could call it) of this site. Basically, it's just a list of other sites that I visit a lot and what books I've been reading or plan to read in the near future. Pretty soon (once I've figured out how to make appropriate use of the [Winamp module](https://web.archive.org/web/20030803121737/http://www.shalabhchaturvedi.com/creations/about_winamp_py.html) for [Python](https://web.archive.org/web/20030803121737/http://python.org/)) I'll also be adding a list of the what music I've been listening to.
