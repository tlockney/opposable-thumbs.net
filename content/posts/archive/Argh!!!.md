Blosxom just screwed up the ordering of my entries below. I know part of this is probably because I use [Unison](https://web.archive.org/web/20030803121737/http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/) to synchronize my files between my Windows boxes and my unix server... or maybe it's because I edited one of those old entries. Damnit, I don't know, but it's annoying. I'll fix it later.
