I've been thinking lately about how I really should maybe start posting more about the work and project related stuff that I've been doing, but it's become clear to me that the small handful of people who actually read this site tend more towards the friends and family category, so in order to avoid boring the living bejezus out you, I've decided to just go ahead and start a second blog. This one's all techie, all the time. You can find it over [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20040403125935/http://opposable-thumbs.net/devblog/ "Opposable Thumbs Development Blog"), if you're really interested, though you might also soon see links to the new posts over in that sidebar thing on the right. Who knows when I'll get around to implementing that, though.
