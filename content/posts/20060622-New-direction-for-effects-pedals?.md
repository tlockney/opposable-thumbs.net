I've long thought that it would be really slick to instrument some of my guitar effect pedals with a couple of [PIC](https://web.archive.org/web/20070613015007/http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&nodeId=74) chips to add in some nice computer control capabilities. Being able to to control the volume, tone and sustain all in sync on a [Big Muff](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Big_Muff) pedal all while playing some whacked out [Chrome](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Chrome_(band))-esque riffs would be truely sweet.

I've heard of other doing things similar to this on various DIY forums and such, but it looks like Guyatone is [getting in on the game](https://musicthing.blogspot.com/2006/06/guyatone-optical-huge-expensive-analog.html) with some nice (though not cheap) commercial models.

> The signal path is all analog, with digital circuitry to control the analog components (a bit like a modern Moog synth).
