Time for a very brief rant on web design: I find it strangely ironic that [this article](https://web.archive.org/web/20040403125935/http://alistapart.com/articles/goingtoprint/) by Eric Meyer and his [blog entry](https://web.archive.org/web/20040403125935/http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/articles/webrev/200001.html "Print Different") on the same topic both fail to print in any reasonable way. In both cases they print in a very awful, large font. The code excerpts don't even fit on the page! I've tested this in both IE and Firefox on Windows and tried playing with my local font settings, so I really don't think it's just me. Well, back to our regularly scheduled programming...
