So, I've recently stumbled on the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) and, more specifically, [Mule](https://web.archive.org/web/20040902204138/http://wiki.muleumo.org/display/MULE/Home "Mule"). I'm doing research into application integration and poking around the various information sources on MOMs, I ran into this ESB concept. Then, I was browsing through the books at Borders and happened upon a [new Oreilly book](https://web.archive.org/web/20040902204138/http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/esb/) on the subject. 

I'm not sure I've gotten the full picture yet, and I'm sure that the commercial offerings are probably quite a bit different from Mule, but what I see so far is appealing. We already have one in house system devoted to cross-system EDI between our internal lab systems and our external customers systems. A lot of what I see in Mule looks like a generalization of the same ideas.
