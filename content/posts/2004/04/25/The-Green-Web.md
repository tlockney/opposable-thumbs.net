Here's a great idea: [Sascha Brawer](https://web.archive.org/web/20040520204732/http://www.brawer.ch/blog/2004/04/23#SustainableWebHosting "Sascha Brawer's Blog") is responsible for finding hosting for his local green party's website and realized that he should find a solution that uses renewable energy. He's doing this in Switzerland, but I would hope there's options here in the States, too.
