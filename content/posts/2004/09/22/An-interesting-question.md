> This ultimately comes down to how one views the human race: Are we the inheriters of the Earth, free to do with it as we will? Or, are we the stewards of the Earth, responsible for looking out for others species? Or, are we just a cog in the wheel, our actions no more or less unplanned or unintented by Mother Nature?  

Personally, I think we are stewards. At least I would say that we have taken on that role through our actions. If we decide to cut down a forest in order to build our homes and businesses then we have the responsibility to handle the consequences.
