[Garrison Keillor](https://web.archive.org/web/20040924085445/http://www.inthesetimes.com/site/main/article_rss/were_not_in_lake_wobegon_anymore/ "We're Not in Lake Wobegon Anymore: How did the Party of Lincoln and Liberty transmogrify into the party of Newt Gingrich's evil spawn and their Etch-A-Sketch president, a dull and rigid man, whose philosophy is a jumble of badly sutured body parts trying to walk? -- In These Times"), yes _THE_ Garrison Keillor of Prairie Home Companion fame, the man who I fondly remember listening to back in my youngest days, tears apart the Republican Party:

> Our beloved land has been fogged with fear--fear, the greatest political strategy ever. An ominous silence, distant sirens, a drumbeat of whispered warnings and alarms to keep the public uneasy and silence the opposition. And in a time of vague fear, you can appoint bullet-brained judges, strip the bark off the Constitution, eviscerate federal regulatory agencies, bring public education to a standstill, stupefy the press, lavish gorgeous tax breaks on the rich.
