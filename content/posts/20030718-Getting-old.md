I just noticed that the content on this site is getting so old and is so poorly maintained/updated that the sidebar on the right isn't displaying correctly. And this isn't even the first time I've noticed that. I guess it's time to start with the inane updates about my life and crap like that, eh? I mean, that's what you want isn't it? Most of the links I give you are just stuff I've found somewhere else and I'm sure most of you read those sites anyways right? Oh wait, no one reads this site, so why do I care? Call it personal pride of ownership/workmanship/whatever.

And this has been another pointless update from your daily automated weblog update service.
