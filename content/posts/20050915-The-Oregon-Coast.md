Nicole, the doggies and I went to [Cannon Beach](http://www.cannonbeach.org/) this last weekend. It was gorgeous weather for it and we had a splendid time. I’ve upload some of the photos to flickr. Check them out [here ](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tlockney/sets/953505/)and [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tlockney/sets/953450/). That second set is of the [sitka spruce](http://lewisandclarktrail.com/section4/orcities/seaside/sitkaspruce.htm) we saw on the way out there. It’s the tallest of it’s kind in the US. It’s an amazing site, but this place is full of things like that.
