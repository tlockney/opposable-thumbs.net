Finally! The [magazine](https://web.archive.org/web/20040902204138/http://make.oreilly.com/) I've been waiting for all my life. 

Announced as OSCON in Portland, Make magazine: "filled with fun projects and hardware hacks involving technology" and "5-minute tips you can use to improve your gadgets, networks, and computers, as well as much longer projects that might take several days (or weeks) to complete."
