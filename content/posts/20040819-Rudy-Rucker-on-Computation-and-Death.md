> Speaking of time, how long does a computation continue?. We won't impose any bound at all. Certain kinds of computation will indeed signal when they've arrived at a desired result --- for instance by beeping or by printing a result --- and then halt in the s	ense of no longer changing their states. But there's a sense in which such computational processes continue after their halting point. It's just that after they halt they remain in a constant state.

Most naturally occurring computational processes are things that we like to keep going as long as possible.
