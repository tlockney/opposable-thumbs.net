This is the first entry in my new blog. I'm trying out [blosxom](https://web.archive.org/web/20030803121737/http://www.oreillynet.com/~rael/lang/perl/blosxom) for the first time. I believe I will probably be making some simple modifications to it though. For one, I don't see any reason for it not to be a bit more flexible in it's templating so I'll probably add support for the HTML::Template module. That'll come later, though. For now it's simple, easy to use and quick to setup. This entry is a good example (I just downloaded the code about 5 minutes ago and I already have my first entry up).
