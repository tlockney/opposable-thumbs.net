## This site

A collection of miscellaneous thoughts and whatnots. I started the blog "Opposable Thumbs" ([evidence](https://web.archive.org/web/20030714063331/http://opposable-thumbs.net/)) many years ago before social media was really what it is today, so much of what you see in the archives is reflective of the lack of that outlet. Take it for what it is.

## The author

I am a Portland, Oregon based engineering leader with a long standing obsession with learning and problem solving. I spend a lot of my time reading and researching, but I’m most happy when I’m able to work collaboratively with a team, applying our collective experience and problem solving strategies to address real challenges. I consider myself very technical, though I spend a lot less time immersed in coding and details of each and every stack we leverage than I used to as an individual contributor or even a first-level manager. I enjoy maintaining a broad view of the software development landscape and lean towards being a generalist, but I have spent the most time focused on backend, distributed, cloud-based systems with an emphasis on automation and DevOps.

I am currently a Senior Engineering Manager at [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com), where I work in the Marketplace and Strategic Integrations Product Group. That means we focus on the ecosystem that provides solutions built on top of [HubSpot's developer platform](https://developers.hubspot.com/), including those developed internally (hence the strategic integrations) and those built by the community of individual developers, agencies, and solution providers. It's still early for me there, but I'm enthusiastic about what I've seen so far both of HubSpot as a whole and of the teams I'm working with.

Through June of 2021, I was employed at Nike as a Senior Engineering Manager in the Marketing Technology org, leading a number of teams focused on building out the Nike Communications Platform. Prior to that, I was responsible for leading the development of the Nike Activity Platform. If you've used the [Nike Run Club](https://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/running/nike-run-club) or [Nike Training Club](https://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/nike-plus/training-app) apps, the systems managing that data were built by the team I helped lead.

I was also the host of the Nike Tech Talks, a highly successful series of events showcasing world class subject matter experts from across the industry, an internal evangelist for and organizer of our open-source program, and an advocate for building strong and healthy engineering cultures.

At various times throughout my career I have been:

* a software engineer, architect, and leader (both tech lead and people manager)
* the founder and organizer of the now defunct [PNWScala](http://pnwscala.org/) conference
* a conference speaker at OSCON (2010, [2015](https://youtu.be/7R5FLvr-aBE)) & [AWS re:invent 2016](https://youtu.be/-LiQCpPj8RM)
* a user group founder & organizer, including [DorkbotPDX](http://dorkbotpdx.org/), [PDXScala](https://www.meetup.com/PDXScala/), and various others
* a presenter at a variety of user groups, meetups, and corporate events
* a proofreader and reviewer for many technical books

I have more books than I know what to do with and not enough time to read them all. Which is how it should be. I adore dogs, especially my own, and I love watching movies and binging on great TV shows with my wife.
