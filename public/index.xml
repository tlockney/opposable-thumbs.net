      <description>Update: unfortunately, the Safari Books blog no longer seems to be around, so the following links are all pointed at their Archive.org copies.
Recently I was asked to write a few posts for the Safari Books Online blog. They were looking for Scala content, so I suggested Akka as a central theme. I wrote these posts with an audience in mind that hopefully would have been exposed to Scala (or could, at least, read a short Scala tutorial), but who had not yet written any Akka code.</description>

      <description>The other day, I found myself in a series of discussions with some fellow developers, in part about the performance characteristics of large numbers of threads in a JVM running on a Linux system. While I would not claim to be any sort of expert on the subject, it was clear that some of the information I had thought was fairly well known, was not nearly as pervasive as I assumed.</description>

      <description>A couple days ago I was playing around with my Emacs configuration a bit and decided to see if I could find ways to make it a more direct part of my flow (whatever the hell that means). For a quick sample of sorts, I threw together this little hack that let&amp;rsquo;s me popup a quick Emacs window with a buffer that&amp;rsquo;s already running haskell-mode (I assume here that you already have it installed, if not, you can find info on the haskell-mode page).</description>

      <description>This is a review I wrote on Amazon for Programming Collective Intelligence by Toby Segaran. I decided I should post a copy of it here for safe keeping. I hope to write a more detailed review of it at some point, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see how far that idea gets.
I first learned of this book just a few weeks ago, shortly before it was available. I immediately read the sample chapter on the publisher&amp;rsquo;s website and was certain I had to get a hold of a copy.</description>

      <guid>/posts/2007/10/practical-ruby-for-systems-admistration-review/</guid>
      <description>This is a brief review I wrote of Practical Ruby for System Administration by Andr√© Ben Hamou. I was going to try and have it published elsewhere, but decided I should post it here.
Ruby has been growing at a staggering rate of popularity over the last couple of years. In particular, its use as a web-programming language has probably not failed to get many peoples&#39; attention. However, given the precedence set by languages like Perl and Python for use in systems administration related work and the undisputed reality that Ruby has been influenced by these predecessors (in particular Perl), it should come as no surprise that its growth in the sysadmin world has been similarly on the upswing.</description>

      <description>So, in the effort to get myself setup to work on my desktop machine, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about a different approach to my workspace configuration. I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about the physical workspace, though I&amp;rsquo;ve had many thoughts about that, too. This is about my virtual workspace. Really, truly virtual.
Some people know that I&amp;rsquo;ve been a long-time fan of VMware. I think I first started using around 1999 or 2000, when it was still a very early and somewhat rough bit of software.</description>

      <description>Ok, so here&amp;rsquo;s the deal, my laptop (supplied by my employer) is kaput. The BIOS started report SMART errors about a month ago, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t worry about it too much. I never got any errors while using it, so I just backed everything up and figured eventually I&amp;rsquo;d get them to send me a new drive.
But then it got worse: the LCD started going crazy. It would randomly fade to a sort of greenish, off-white color.</description>

      <description>Once again the Portland Ruby Brigade will be hosting an evening of wide ranging talks about Ruby. This year the focus is on people doing strange things with Ruby. Strange, of course, is anything just a bit outside the usual. If you&amp;rsquo;ve created a new Ruby-based interface for hacking your brand new internet-enabled phone (rPhone anyone?) or composed your latest bit of metaprogramming magic, we&amp;rsquo;d love to hear about it.</description>

      <description>So, it occured to me that after soliciting everyone in DorkbotPDX to post the announcement for this to their blogs, I failed to do so myself. Bad self! So, here it is, the official announcement for the first ever DorkbotPDX event:
Come join DorkbotPDX, people doing strange things with electricity, for our inaugural event at Vendetta on June 24th at 5pm. If you&amp;rsquo;re a hacker, painter, engineer or sculpture, musician or maker you&amp;rsquo;ll fit right in.</description>

      <description>A while back I agreed to do tech reviews for two Ruby books from O‚ÄôReilly. The first of these, Ajax on Rails by Scott Raymond, was just published a few weeks ago. It looks to be quite an excellent piece of work (of course, I know the tech reviewing was top notch ;~). I just received word that the second, Rails Cookbook by Rob Orsini, has been published, too.
Both look to be worth picking up.</description>

      <description>well, sorta anyway. I did some more playing around with why&amp;rsquo;s modifications to mod_ruby and was able to throw together a quick test to show that in fact it should be quite possible to implement a SiteMesh-like system using Apache, mod_ruby (patched) and Hpricot. Here&amp;rsquo;s, in short, how I did it.
First, I downloaded Apache 2.0.59 since that&amp;rsquo;s close to the version we&amp;rsquo;re running on the server on which I&amp;rsquo;ll eventually be using this system (it&amp;rsquo;s actually 2.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on setting up some servers for a project with which I&amp;rsquo;m involved (in all my infinite spare time). These servers are going to have a variety of web applications running (some of which will be third-party), but we (that is, me and the other guy ;~) would like to keep a somewhat consistent look &amp;amp; feel across the board.
Of course, the obvious solution is to just edit the templates provided with each application (assuming the have templates at all).</description>

      <description>Late last night while trying to get rails running on a server I was setting up, I ran into an odd error. Sadly, I failed to save the error message itself and my browser history has been woefully unhelpful in finding the google searches I did to track down the issue. However, I can recreate the sequence of steps I took to fix the problem.
First, though, let me give you the scenario.</description>

      <description>So, just a quick update to let everyone know why I&amp;rsquo;ve disappeared and have been unable to find even a few spare seconds to update the blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve been just a wee bit busy.
Last month I attended OSCON and helped put on FOSCON II. Both of which were awesome and exhausting. I met a lot of great people and learned about some interesting things. Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll find time to dig in a bit deeper on some of it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to give a new browser a spin and see how it handles things. As my last post may have indicated to you already, the browser in question is called Flock. It makes a claim towards being the browser for the web 2.0 world. Well, maybe not so specifically, but it integrates various web-services in an attempt to make the browsing experience a little more&amp;hellip; well, just more. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to explain exactly what it brings to the table without simply listing it&amp;rsquo;s features and that&amp;rsquo;s just boring, so I&amp;rsquo;ll leave it to this fine review on ExtremeTech to do that for me.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve long thought that it would be really slick to instrument some of my guitar effect pedals with a couple of PIC chips to add in some nice computer control capabilities. Being able to to control the volume, tone and sustain all in sync on a Big Muff pedal all while playing some whacked out Chrome-esque riffs would be truely sweet.
I&amp;rsquo;ve heard of other doing things similar to this on various DIY forums and such, but it looks like Guyatone is getting in on the game with some nice (though not cheap) commercial models.</description>

I‚Äôve only played around with creating Camping applications a little bit, but I‚Äôve found it‚Äôs quite intuitive and easy. The funny thing about this is that the source of Camping itself is quite the opposite in many ways.</description>

Tonight I was working on a little side project I‚Äôm doing. I needed to pull a bunch of legacy data into a new table for event data. To make this work, I created a set of models that referenced the old tables, using the syntax ActiveRecord provides to override it‚Äôs default settings.</description>

 Oh, and as for patterns hidden in pi, we‚Äôve already found one. It‚Äôs called the circle. Just because humans discovered circles first and pi later shouldn‚Äôt mean that the latter is derived from the former.

      <description>Matt asks an interesting question: 
 This ultimately comes down to how one views the human race: Are we the inheriters of the Earth, free to do with it as we will? Or, are we the stewards of the Earth, responsible for looking out for others species? Or, are we just a cog in the wheel, our actions no more or less unplanned or unintented by Mother Nature?
 Personally, I think we are stewards.</description>

 On which point, incidentally, I&amp;rsquo;m vaguely (ie not really) hoping for a Bush victory: not for political reasons [as much as I&amp;rsquo;m allowed to given my British citizenship and living in Italy and all, I find the guy deeply objectionable on every count] but because a Bush victory will hopefully cause the US Liberals to either rent some cojones from someone or move en masse over here.</description>

      <description>Garrison Keillor, yes THE Garrison Keillor of Prairie Home Companion fame, the man who I fondly remember listening to back in my youngest days, tears apart the Republican Party:
 Our beloved land has been fogged with fear&amp;ndash;fear, the greatest political strategy ever. An ominous silence, distant sirens, a drumbeat of whispered warnings and alarms to keep the public uneasy and silence the opposition. And in a time of vague fear, you can appoint bullet-brained judges, strip the bark off the Constitution, eviscerate federal regulatory agencies, bring public education to a standstill, stupefy the press, lavish gorgeous tax breaks on the rich.</description>

 Speaking of time, how long does a computation continue?. We won&amp;rsquo;t impose any bound at all. Certain kinds of computation will indeed signal when they&amp;rsquo;ve arrived at a desired result &amp;mdash; for instance by beeping or by printing a result &amp;mdash; and then halt in the s	ense of no longer changing their states. But there&amp;rsquo;s a sense in which such computational processes continue after their halting point.</description>

      <description>Michael Fremer reveiws the Wavac SH-833 monoblock power amplifier. Now, granted, this is a review of a $350,000 amplifier, but this line just kills me:
 There&amp;rsquo;s nothing outrageous about spending a million bucks on a painting or a vintage automobile.
 Pretty bold statement. Then again, this guy did try this thing out with London Calling, so I have to give him some credit. And, for that matter, the lucky bastard got to listen to this thing (these, really, it&amp;rsquo;s a matched pair of amps) for two whole months.</description>

      <description>Jon Eaves describes what he refers to as the consulting dilemma, that is, the fact that as a consultant you are usually brought in to work with companies that you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t ever choose to work for and often in the worst of circumstances (the project has run off track, the team has no process defined, the architecture is a mess or nonexistent).
While I&amp;rsquo;m not a consultant, I have thought a lot about this issue.</description>

      <description>This sounds painfully familiar:
 I was talking to a programmer today who works for a business who does business software development for a large client. Their process is that the client sends a requirements document, they go back and forth a few times to sort out some detail, and he codes the software or enhancement.
He never, ever sees a user, does not know who they are or what they do.</description>

      <description>I had a chance to read a little of the 9/11 Commission Report very early this morning and was struck immediately by its studied ignorance of embarrassing facts. It seems to seek ways around identifying the United States&#39; (and, by extension, the administrations of presidents since 1980) in creating the monster that attacked us on September 11, 2001.

      <description>I just discovered the term &amp;ldquo;physical computing,&amp;rdquo; which is used to describe the design and implementation of the hardware interface between man and machine. Tom Igoe teaches Physical Computing as part of the Interactive Telecommunications Program, Tisch School of the Arts, NYU.
From his blog:
 What is physical computing? It&amp;rsquo;s an approach to learning how humans communicate through computers that starts by considering how humans express themselves physically. A lot of beginning computer interface design instruction takes the computer hardware for given &amp;ndash; namely, that there is a keyboard, a screen, perhaps speakers, and a mouse &amp;ndash; and concentrates on teaching the software necessary to design within those boundaries.</description>

      <description>Ever since I met Nicole one of the many, many things I&amp;rsquo;ve admired about her is the clear sense of the projects, goals and to-do list type items she has to take care of. Of course, she&amp;rsquo;s a keep of lists, something I&amp;rsquo;ve never been very good at. Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to try and start making this an element of my organizational strategy (if you can call it that). I asked Nicole for advice and she suggested that I start with a list of my projects.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s one to think about &amp;ndash; it even seems obivous in retrospect. Researchers have determined that our cities are built on the most fertile lands, which is impacting the climate since that land is critical in the overall cycle of the ecosystem. It appears that our yearly 1.8 percent gain in NPP (Net Primary Productivity &amp;ndash; a measure of plant growth based on the rate of carbon absorption) is being offset by a 1.</description>

      <description>Today I woke up with a funny feeling in my lungs. It was like a tickle that no matter how much I hacked and coughed just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t go away. There was a light constriction to my breathing so I pretty much knew right away this wasn&amp;rsquo;t just some normal run of the mill congestion (it is that time of year after all).
As a child I regularly in and out of various doctor&amp;rsquo;s offices.</description>

Some mornings just aren&amp;rsquo;t worth getting up for. That&amp;rsquo;s what I learned today.
You see it all started when I stopped at the ATM to get some cash so that I could buy an espresso on the way in to the office. When I was walking back to my truck I noticed that my left rear tire was almost entirely flat.</description>

Granted, that may have been how others would have described us, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to really capture the way we thought of ourselves.</description>

      <description>Last night I was at Little City with Nicole, when I ran into my friend John who I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen in ages. John is a fascinating character. He teaches astronomy classes at Austin Community College and tutors in math and physics. In addition to all this, he has a deep connection with the truely spiritual aspects of the world.
Our conversation last night began with a question about a book he was reading on Tibetan yogas and progressed through a relating of various experiences and thoughts on how the spiritual can creep up on even a cynical, critic like myself.</description>

      <description>The previous entry&amp;rsquo;s mention of needing enough variety to make a reasonable selection about which school for Nicole to attend remind me of another interesting subject which I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading about lately: Stafford Beer.
Beer, who I was not familiar with until just recently, was the founder of managerial cybernetics. Before you turn your attention elsewhere, let me point out that this is not nearly as boring (in my eyes anyway) as you might think.</description>

      <description>Well, as usual, it&amp;rsquo;s been a while. The biggest news I can come up with at the moment is that we&amp;rsquo;ve expanded the list of choices for our move next year. After some serious discussion about which schools Nicole&amp;rsquo;s applying to, we decided that we should probably look a little more abroad. Not that we have any problem with Boston, it&amp;rsquo;s just that certain decisions she had made about the schools there and the line of reasoning we had used to choose the right schools for her had eliminated all but two schools from the list: Harvard and Boston University (at least at that point).</description>

I guess it occured to me when a co-worker of mine brought up a program he was enrolling in that would allow him to continue working towards his computer science degree in the evenings. Of course, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen plenty of programs like this, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t know there were any in Austin.</description>

      <description>Just realized that I have not linked to Vernor Vinge&amp;rsquo;s article on the singularity (which you can read here). The reason I bring this up is this article which a coworker just refered me to. It talks about the coming robotic age (my appelation for it, not his) and it&amp;rsquo;s affect on our economy. The reasons this caught my eye are twofold: one, it evokes the idea of the singularity and what might happen when all of this technology accelerates to these speeds; and, two, the idea that our economy is not quite prepared to handle this sort of change.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a quote from the Neil Gershenfeld article I linked to in the previous entry that I find particularly intriguing:
 The kind of taxonomy that biologists do has to turn into predictive design theories. Shannon did that once. He showed that the channel capacity, that threshold I was talking about, is equal to bandwidth times the logarithm of 1 plus the signal-to noise ratio. That let you suddenly take these disparate attributes and, independent of the details of a particular design, learn how to price them and trade them off.</description>

      <description>In the latest edition of EDGE there&amp;rsquo;s a great article from Neil Gershenfeld on the empowerment of people through enabling technology. In this case, though, we&amp;rsquo;re not talking so much about the usual digitial technology (the internet and it&amp;rsquo;s related mechanisms) so much as fabrication tools and microcontrollers. A few choice excerpts:
 In support of this basic research we started teaching a class, modestly called &amp;ldquo;How To Make (almost) Anything,&amp;rdquo; where we show students how to use the millions of dollars of machines available at MIT for making things.</description>

      <description> First Law: When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong. Second Law: The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible. Third Law: Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.  </description>

      <description>Yup, that&amp;rsquo;s right, as the title says, we&amp;rsquo;ve decided Boston is the place. Nicole&amp;rsquo;s applying to law school for next year and we&amp;rsquo;ve decided that instead of applying all over the place she&amp;rsquo;s just going to apply to schools in the Boston area. I think the list includes Suffolk, Northeastern, Boston University and Harvard last I heard. Seems like I&amp;rsquo;m forgetting one, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure she&amp;rsquo;ll tell me when she reads this.</description>

Whether it is to be Utopian or Oblivion will be a touch-and-go relay race right up to the final moment.</description>
