<p>I&rsquo;m a Portland, Oregon based software engineer and leader passionate about building great engineering teams with a focus on autonomy and accountability. I&rsquo;m currently employed at Nike as a Senior Engineering Manager where I work as part of the Nike Digital Platform Engineering organization. If you&rsquo;ve used the <a href="https://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/running/nike-run-club">Nike Run Club</a> or <a href="https://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/nike-plus/training-app">Nike Training Club</a> apps, your data is managed by the systems built by a team I helped lead. My team&rsquo;s current focus is on building better capabilities to power our digital marketing and membership engagement as part of the Nike Communications Platform.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also the host of the Nike Tech Talks, a highly successful series of events showcasing world class subject matter experts from across the industry, an internal evangelist for and organizer of our open-source program, and a champion of building a strong and healthy engineering culture.</p>
<p>At various times I have been:</p>
<ul>
<li>a software engineer, architect, and leader (both tech lead and people manager)</li>
<li>the founder and organizer of the now defunct <a href="http://pnwscala.org/">PNWScala</a> conference</li>
<li>a conference speaker at OSCON (2010, <a href="https://youtu.be/-LiQCpPj8RM">2015</a>) &amp; <a href="https://youtu.be/7R5FLvr-aBE">AWS re:invent 2016</a></li>
<li>a user group founder &amp; organizer, including <a href="http://dorkbotpdx.org/">DorkbotPDX</a>, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/PDXScala/">PDXScala</a>, and various others</li>
<li>a presenter at a variety of user groups, meetups, and company events</li>
<li>a proofreader and reviewer for numerous technical books</li>
</ul>
<p>I have more books than I know what to do with and not enough time to read them all. Which is how it should be. I adore dogs, especially my own, and I love watching movies and binging on great TV shows (mostly British) with my wife.</p>
