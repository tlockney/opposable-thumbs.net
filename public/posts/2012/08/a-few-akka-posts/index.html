      <p><em><strong>Update</strong>: unfortunately, the Safari Books blog no longer seems to be around, so the following links are all pointed at their <a href="https://web.archive.org">Archive.org</a> copies.</em></p>
<p>Recently I was asked to write a few posts for the <a href="http://blog.safaribooksonline.com/">Safari Books Online blog</a>. They were looking for Scala content, so I suggested Akka as a central theme. I wrote these posts with an audience in mind that hopefully would have been exposed to Scala (or could, at least, read a short Scala tutorial), but who had not yet written any Akka code. These posts will be nothing really new for experienced Akka developers, but clearly that&rsquo;s not the point.</p>
<p>My main motivation in doing this has been that I&rsquo;ve consistently noticed a need for a very simple introduction to Akka. I&rsquo;ve seen this at <a href="http://pdxscala.org">PDXScala</a> meetings, in the <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net?channels=akka">#akka</a> IRC channel and through a variety of other forums. It&rsquo;s not that there aren&rsquo;t other good introductions out there (<a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.0.3/intro/getting-started.html">the one included in the Akka documentation</a> itself is quite good). But it helps to provide more. In particular, I wanted to present them without overloading the reader with inessential details that might complicate the understanding.</p>
<p>Here are the posts I wrote in the order I had originally intended them. I made the mistake of not being terribly explicit in my final submission, so they were actually published in a slightly different order.</p>
